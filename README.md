This code is terrible!

**What is this?**

At it's heart, this tweak is designed to automatically lock an iPhone if it is put in a pocket without locking it first. However, it can also be used to lock the iPhone with a wave of your hand over the proximity sensor, to create a smart cover for iPhone, and many other uses. 

**What hardware does it use?**

Only the proximity sensor, and any battery loss as a result of using this sensor is more than made up by that saved by locking the iPhone.

**Which devices does it support?**

Anything with a proximity sensor! So, all models of the iPhone, '2G' through to the current 5, although this is dependant on whether it works all the way back to iOS 3, or just iOS 6+.

**Known Bugs**

- There is no locking in the camera if it is launched from the lockscreen
- The UI freezes when getting second proximity value, need to do this on a separate thread
- The second proximity value always evaluates to yes - need a way of getting second proximity value, UIDevice's proximityState always returns NO?
- Proximity monitoring is turned off after a phone call, and a toggle on/off from preferences is required to re-enable it, but only when using Callbar or other such tweaks.
- After a reboot or respring, the lockscreen accepts proximity events, and locks itself, casuing a respring - could be unrelated to tweak, need testers to confirm
- Proximity sensor is disabled in landscape - appears to be an iOS bug

**TODO**

- Fix bugs!
- Test as appropriate
- Add new features

**Things to test**

- Older devices on older iOS versions
- Lockscreen "bug"
- Raise to speak for Siri
- Phone calls via Callbar etc
- Locking animation tweaks such as SleepFX
- Apps that utilise the proximity sensor

Hint: When using this to lock your iPhone with a hand gesture, don't forget to feel like a Jedi ;)
