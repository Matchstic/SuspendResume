			<string>This setting allows you to simply &quot;suspend&quot; your iPhone instead of fully locking it. This way, you won&apos;t have to go through the lockscreen to continue what you were doing, instead, just pull out your phone and carry on. However, your iPhone will still lock after the time set for auto-locking, so it is only good for a short period of time. Also, if you have a passcode set, this is a large security risk, as it allows people to easily bypass the lockscreen.</string>
